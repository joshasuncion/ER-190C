    "In this homework, we will investigate air quality data retreived from the EPA. The main goal for this assignment is to understand how PM2.5 FRM/FEM Mass effects air quality. We will accomplish this by analyzing EPA data and utilizing pandas (a powerful Python data analysis toolkit). To give us a sense of how we think about each discovery we make and what next steps it leads to we will provide comments and insights along the way.\n",

    "* Computing numeric operations (mean, variance)\n",
